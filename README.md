# Navi-V0.4

If you'd like to use Navi-V0.4 (My personal prototype is Sapphire.EXE) then all you need to do is clone the git repository, install python and python-is-python3, install openai with pip, naivagte to Navi-V0.4/core/, and run entry.py

you will also need to export your OpenAI api key with "export AI_KEY="your_key_here" and "export AI_ORG="your_key_here".

Formal install instructions coming later.
