Hy is a powerful tool for anyone who is comfortable with Lisp but needs to work with Python libraries or existing Python code."

This compiled bytecode can then be imported and executed within Python programs alongside regular Python code. \n\nHy also supports direct Python interop through a `!` operator, which allows executing Python code from within a Hy program. This means that you can easily call Python functions and import Python modules within a Hy program. \n\nTo summarize, Hy interops with Python in two ways:\n1. By compiling Hy code into Python bytecode for use within a Python program\n2. By allowing direct Python interop through the `!` operator."
